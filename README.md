 ### Additional help
 When working there are fellow developer who are also trying to fix other issue. Which makes ***your*** source stale. To fix it you need to get the fresh source. So how to do it.

#### Avoid Conflicts (Syncing your fork) 

An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PR's may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.

```terminal
git remote add upstream https://github.com/cestaSociety/hacktoberfest2021
```
 You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing:

```terminal
git remote -v
```

To pull any new changes from your parent repo simply run:

```terminal
git merge upstream/master
```

This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo. It's a good idea to use it frequently in between your own commits to make sure that your repo is up to date with its parent.
